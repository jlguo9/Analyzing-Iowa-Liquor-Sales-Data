# CMPT 732 Big Data Project

## Problem definition: 
What is the problem that you are trying to solve? What are the challenges of this problem?

When any business owner decides to open a new store(or expanding an existing business) at new city or a new neighbourhood, It can be challenging for business owners to decide on the best location for their stores so that they can make more profits.
Not only that, a few more questions arise such as

- How are the sales of specific products of their domain?
- How much revenue does other business in same domian make?
- What products drives the most sales?
- What are the most popular products among different regions of the city they plan to expand or open their business in?
- Are there any seasonal changes in how products are consumed? 

Analysis on above questions is necessary to take decisions such as the optimal location for their business,  what products they will sell, and how to increase sales when starting a new or
expanding an existing business in a new city.


Therefore, by examining the past sales data, our
initiative intends to provide analysis on above mentioned questions to inform them with knowledge that can assist them in making profitable decisions.

Now, we plan to test the this strategy on the *["Liquor sales"](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy)* dataset presented by Iowa Govt. 

Also, the above strategy can be extended to provide these analysis to stores in other domains.
For example, if Safeway plans to open a new store in a new city, we can provide them with answers to above questions and help them maximize their profits 


## Methodology: 
What is the problem that you are trying to solve? Briefly explain which tool(s)/technique(s) were used for which task and why you chose to implement that way.

As we mentioned, we used *["IOWA Liquor sales data"](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy)* published by IOWA Government.
Now, after obtaining the data, the next task was to clean it, extract-transform-load it into a Data Warehouse and then eventually into a Data Mart, and then generate reports like grouping the most popular drink by region. And the final stage i.e. to visualize the data and make it presentable to the clients.
