# Optimizing Profit


### Problem
Assuming that the capital at hand is certain, how can we try to maximize the profit? 

Here we try to find the list of top products of last 6 months which has maximum profit margin(sales price - retail price) and at the same time are sold fater than other products, therefore, giving the business owner maximum profit in less time, i.e. finding Capital turnover rate /Wine inventory which means The more frequently you buy, the higher the capital turnover rate.


### Results
We found that Products like "HA last  DROP Scotch" and "Remy Martin  Louis" can give profit upto **USD 1000** per bottle. 

Following Graph shows the top 5 products to invest in

And selling just 100s of these bottles can give profit of atleast **USD 100,000** in just 6 months
